A *computer system* consists of hardware and systems software that work together to run application programs.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello, world\n");
    return 0;
}
```
The hello program

## Information Is Bits + Context

Our hello program begins life as a *source program* (or *source file*) that the programmer creates with an editor and saves in a text file called `hello.c`. The source program is a sequence of bits, each with a value of 0 or 1, organized in 8-bit chunks called *bytes*. Each byte represents some text character in the program.
