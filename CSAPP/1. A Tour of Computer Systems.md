A *computer system* consists of hardware and systems software that work together to run application programs.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello, world\n");
    return 0;
}
```
The hello program

## Information Is Bits + Context

Our hello program begins life as a *source program* (or *source file*) that the programmer creates with an editor and saves in a text file called `hello.c`. The source program is a sequence of bits, each with a value of 0 or 1, organized in 8-bit chunks called *bytes*. Each byte represents some text character in the program.

>Files consist exclusively of ASCII characters are known as *text files*. All other files are known as *binary files*.

```ad-important
The representation of `hello.c` illustrates a fundamental idea: All information in a system is represented as a bunch of bits. The only thing that distinguishes different data objects is the context in which we view them.
```

## Programs Are Translated by Other Programs into Different Forms

The hello program begins life as a high-level C program because it can be read and understood by human beings in that form. However, in order to run `hello.c` on the system, the individual C statements must be translated by other programs into a sequence of low-level *machine-language* instructions. These instructions are then packaged in a form called an *executable object program* and stored as a binary disk file.

The compilation system

The programs that perform the four phases (*preprocessor*, *compiler*, *assembler*, and *linker*) are known collectively as the *compilication system*:
- *Preprocessing phase*. The preprocessor modifies the original C program according to directives that begin with the '#' character. The result is another C program, typically with the `.i` suffix.
- *Compilation phase*. The compiler translates the text file `hello.i` into the text file `hello.s`, which contains an *assembly-language program*.
- *Assembly phase*. The assembler translates `hello.s` into machine-language instructions, packages them in a form known as a *relocatable object program*, and stores the result in the object file `hello.o`.
- *Linking phase*. The linker merge standard C library with `hello.o` program. The result is the hello file, which is an executable object file (or simply executable) that is ready to be loaded into memory and executed by the system.

## Processors Read and Interpret Instructions Stored in Memory

Hardware organization of a typical system

Running throughout the system is a collection of electrical conduits called *buses* that carry bytes of information back and forth between the components. Buses are typically designed to transfer fixed-size chunks of bytes known as *words*.

Input/output (I/O) devices are the system's connection to the external world. Each I/O device is connected to the I/O bus by either a *controller* or an *adapter*.

The *main memory* is a temporary storage device that holds both a program and the data it manipulates while the processor is executing the program. Physically, main memory consists of a collection of *dynamic random access memory* (DRAM) chips. Logically, memory is organized as a linear array of bytes, each with its own unique address (array index) starting at zero.

The *central processing unit* (CPU), or simply *processor*, is the engine that interprets (or *executes*) instructions stored in main memory. At its core is a word-size storage device ()
